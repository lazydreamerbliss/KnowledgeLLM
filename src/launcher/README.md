## Edit code and debug

When edit UI code (under `./ui`), you just need to save the code and changes will apply automatically **(However, you need manual refresh if you edit code in ./ui/static)**. To debug these code, you just need to debug in the debugger window of electron.

When edit Server code (under `./server`), you just need to save the code and changes will apply automatically. To debug these code, you just need to debug in the vscode.

When edit electron code, you will need to restart debugging in vscode to apply all the changes.
