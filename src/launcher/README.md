## Quick start

5. Press F5 to start debugging
6. Observe the electron window

## Edit code and debug

When edit UI code (under `./UI`), you just need to save the code and changes will apply automatically. To debug these code, you just need to debug in the debugger window of electron.

When edit other code, you will need to wait the build of `npm watch node` command and then restart debugging. To debug these code, just set break points in vscode
